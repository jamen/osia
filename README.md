# Osia
> An elegant Promise-based tasking system.

_Another task manager?_ Yes.  This one works through `Promise` objects, however.  It also aims to be more lightweight, with just as robust features (if not more) than other task managers.

This project is in very early stages, and there is a lot of missing functionality that would otherwise be wanted.  If you have an idea, create an issue, then a pull request if you can.

## Installation
```shell
$ npm install osia
```

## Usage
```javascript
import osia from 'osia';
```
```
$ osia [...tasks]
```

## Documentation
See the [docs] folder for more information on how to use Osia.
